# OpSNuG
OpSNuG in short for Open Source Number Generator, which is my new method of genarating numbers.

> [!CAUTION]
> if you're running on a weak or old cpu(or high end) use this at your own risk as it genarates numbers up to 1e6(1,000,000) so make sure your computer or laptop can handle that, 64 bit cpus' are recommended.
