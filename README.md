# OpSNuG
OpSNuG in short for Open Source Number Generator, which is my new method of genarating numbers.

> [!CAUTION]
> if you're running on a weak or old cpu(or high end) use this at your own risk as it genarates numbers up to 1e6(1,000,000) so make sure your computer or laptop can handle that, 64 bit cpus' are recommended.

# How to use

**In order to use** OpSNuG, you can run the standalone executable (for windows only). A version for Linux(Mainly Ubuntu) will be added soon, and for macOS, we don't know if we will do an official releasefor macOS/iMac due to software restrictions. For linux and macOS/Mac OS X, if you want to use it sooner without the official release of OpSNuG, you may want to use [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/) to use it; according to WineHQ, they informed Linux(and MacOS) users that it work good with simple programs, so try it out! Back to Windows, so to use OpSNuG, its pretty straightforward, so open the commmand line(cmd) and paste in the executable(execverC.exe) path, for example: <YourDrive>:/execverC.exe. After all that, it will automatically create a number for you.
