# OpSNuG
OpSNuG in short for Open Source Number Generator, which is my new method of genarating numbers.

> [!CAUTION]
> if you're running on a weak or old cpu(or high end) use this at your own risk as it genarates numbers up to 1e6(1,000,000) so make sure your computer or laptop can handle that, 64 bit cpus' are recommended.

# How to use

**In order to use** OpSNuG, you can run the standalone executable (for windows only). A version for Linux(Mainly Ubuntu) will be added soon, and for macOS, we don't know if we will do an official releasefor macOS/iMac due to software restrictions. For linux and macOS/Mac OS X, if you want to use it sooner without the official release of OpSNuG, you may want to use [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/) to use it; according to WineHQ, they informed Linux(and MacOS) users that it work good with simple programs, so try it out(since OpSNuG is simple)! Back to Windows, so to use OpSNuG, its pretty straightforward, so open the commmand line(cmd) and paste in the executable(execverC.exe) path, for example: <YourDrive>:/execverC.exe. After all that, it will automatically create a number for you.


## How it works/How it started

How OpSNug works? Well, it all started when I was bored of good old seed methods and other boring stuff, there are interesting ones like checking b/s(beats per/sec) but that has too much hardware requirements; so I came up with a method of using the seed method but modifying it by certain expressions such as exponents(power) and sqrt(square root). which may result in very large numbers, but stil interesting new way.
