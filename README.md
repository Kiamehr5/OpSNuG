# OpSNuG

OpSNuG, short for Open Source Number Generator, is a novel method for generating numbers.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you're running on a weak or old CPU (or high-end), use this at your own risk as it generates numbers up to 1e6 (1,000,000). Ensure your computer or laptop can handle that. 64-bit CPUs are recommended.

To contribute, see `contribute.md`.

## How to Use

To use OpSNuG, you can run the standalone executable (for Windows only). A version for Linux (mainly Ubuntu) will be added soon. For macOS, we're unsure if we will have an official release due to software restrictions. If you want to use it on Linux or macOS/Mac OS X sooner without the official release, you may want to use [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/) to run it. According to WineHQ, it works well with simple programs, so give it a try (since OpSNuG is simple)! To use OpSNuG on Windows, it's straightforward. Open the command line (cmd) and paste the executable path (execverC.exe), for example: `<YourDrive>:/execverC.exe`. After that, it will automatically generate a number for you (keep pasting it until you're done making random numbers).

> [!WARNING]
> For now, only Intel CPUs' are working. We will fix this on version 1.1x and latest version 2

## How It Works/How It Started

How does OpSNuG work? It all started when I was bored of traditional seed methods and other mundane techniques. While there are interesting methods like checking beats per second (b/s), they often have high hardware requirements. So, I devised a method of using the seed method but modifying it with certain expressions such as exponents (power) and square roots (sqrt), which may result in very large numbers but still offer an interesting new approach.
